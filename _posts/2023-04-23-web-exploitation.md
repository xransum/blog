Web exploitation involves identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications and websites. In CTFs, these vulnerabilities are presented as web security challenges where the user needs to exploit a bug to gain higher-level privileges.
As a beginner, it's important to understand common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), server-side request forgery (SSRF), and others. By learning about these vulnerabilities and how to exploit them, you'll develop important skills that will help you succeed in web security challenges. As you progress, you can also learn how to secure web applications and websites to protect against potential attacks.

Some of the most commonly found exploitation's:

- [SQL Injection]({{ base.url | prepend: site.url }}/sql-injection)
- [Command Injection]({{ base.url | prepend: site.url }}/command-injection)
- [Directory Traversal]({{ base.url | prepend: site.url }}/directory-traversal)
- [Cross Site Scripting (XSS)]({{ base.url | prepend: site.url }}/cross-site-scripting-xss)
- [Reflected XSS]({{ base.url | prepend: site.url }}/cross-site-scripting-xss#reflected-xss)
- [Stored XSS]({{ base.url | prepend: site.url }}/cross-site-scripting-xss#stored-xss)
- [DOM XSS]({{ base.url | prepend: site.url }}/cross-site-scripting-xss#dom-xss)
- [Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]({{ base.url | prepend: site.url }}/cross-site-request-forgery-csrf)
- [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)]({{ base.url | prepend: site.url }}/server-side-request-forgery-ssrf)
