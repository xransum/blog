## Introduction to Web Exploitation

Web exploitation involves identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications and websites. In Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions, these vulnerabilities are presented as web security challenges, where participants need to exploit bugs to gain higher-level privileges.

To succeed in web security challenges, it's essential to understand common vulnerabilities and how to exploit them.

## SQL Injection

SQL injection is a technique where an attacker injects malicious SQL code into a web application's database query. This vulnerability can allow unauthorized access, data manipulation, or even complete control of the database.

## Command Injection

Command injection occurs when an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on a web server by manipulating user-supplied data. This vulnerability can lead to remote code execution and compromise the entire system.

## Directory Traversal

Directory traversal, also known as path traversal, is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to access files and directories outside the intended scope of a web application. By manipulating input, an attacker can read sensitive files or execute arbitrary code.

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability that occurs when a web application does not properly sanitize user input and allows malicious scripts to be injected into web pages viewed by other users. XSS can lead to the theft of sensitive information or the execution of arbitrary code in a victim's browser.

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that tricks users into performing unintended actions on a web application in which they are authenticated. By leveraging the trust placed in a user's browser, an attacker can perform actions on behalf of the victim without their knowledge or consent.

## Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to make requests from a vulnerable server to other internal or external resources. This can lead to data exposure, remote code execution, or further attacks on internal systems.

## Conclusion

By understanding and learning how to exploit these common vulnerabilities, you can develop the necessary skills to succeed in web security challenges. Additionally, it's crucial to learn about secure coding practices and implementing security measures to protect web applications and websites from potential attacks.
