# Git Help

This post has one job and one job only: to help you when you need it most. When you're in the middle of a Git operation and you're not sure what to do next, this post will be there for you.

## Terminology

| Term                  | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HEAD**              | The symbolic name for the current commit you're working on. It represents your current position within the commit history.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Index**             | Also known as the staging area or cache, the index is a holding area where changes are prepared before committing them to the repository. It contains a snapshot of the files that will be included in the next commit.                                                                                                                                 |
| **Working Directory** | The directory on your local machine where you're currently working and making changes to your files. It includes all the files and directories in your project.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Remote**            | A remote repository is a version of your repository hosted on a different server. It allows you to collaborate with others and synchronize your changes with the remote repository.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Origin**            | "Origin" is the default name for the remote repository that you cloned your local repository from. It is often used as a reference to the remote repository when pushing or pulling changes.                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Upstream**          | "Upstream" refers to the remote repository that you forked your own repository from. It allows you to keep track of changes made to the original repository and synchronize your forked repository with the upstream repository.                                                                                                                        |
| **Branch**            | A branch is a lightweight pointer to a specific commit. It allows you to work on different versions of your code in parallel. The default branch in Git is typically named "master" (although this can be changed).                                                                                                                                     |
| **Master**            | "Master" is the default branch name in Git. It is often used as the main branch where the latest stable code resides. You can create new branches from the master branch to develop new features or make changes.                                                                                                                                       |
| **Commit**            | A commit represents a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. It includes the changes you have made to the files in your working directory and is stored in the Git repository's history. Each commit has a unique identifier (hash) that allows you to reference it.                                                                  |
| **Merge**             | A merge is an operation that combines two or more branches by integrating the changes from one branch into another. It creates a new commit that represents the combination of the changes from the merged branches.                                                                                                                                    |
| **Rebase**            | Rebase is an operation that allows you to move or combine a sequence of commits to a new base commit. It effectively integrates the changes from one branch onto another by replaying the commits on top of a different commit.                                                                                                                         |
| **Pull**              | A pull is a command that fetches the latest changes from a remote repository and integrates them into the current branch by performing a merge. It is equivalent to running `git fetch` followed by `git merge`.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Fetch**             | Fetch is a command that downloads the latest changes from a remote repository without integrating them into the current branch. It updates the remote tracking branches, allowing you to see the changes made by others before deciding how to incorporate them.                                                                                        |
| **Push**              | Push is a command that uploads your local commits to a remote repository, updating the corresponding branch in the remote repository with your changes. It allows you to share your work and collaborate with others.                                                                                                                                   |
| **Amend**             | Amend is a command used to modify the most recent commit. It allows you to add changes to the previous commit, change the commit message, or both. The amended commit replaces the previous commit in the repository's history.                                                                                                                         |
| **Cherry Pick**       | Cherry pick is a command that allows you to select and apply a specific commit from one branch onto another branch. It copies the changes made in the selected commit and creates a new commit in the target branch.                                                                                                                                    |
| **Revert**            | Revert is a command used to undo the changes made in a specific commit by creating a new commit that undoes those changes. It is a safe way to remove the effects of a commit without rewriting the commit history.                                                                                                                                     |
| **Stash**             | Stash is a command that allows you to save your changes in a temporary area without committing them. It is useful when you need to switch branches or apply other changes before coming back to your original work. You can later apply or drop the stashed changes.                                                                                    |
| **Tag**               | A tag is a reference to a specific commit in Git that is used to mark important points in your project's history, such as release versions. Tags are typically used to create stable references that don't move as new commits are added.                                                                                                               |
| **Reflog**            | Reflog stands for "reference log" and is a log that records all the changes to branch references and other references in your repository. It allows you to recover lost commits or branches and provides a history of all the actions performed on your repository.                                                                                     |
| **Reset**             | Reset is a command used to move a branch pointer to a different commit. It allows you to "reset" the state of the branch to a previous commit, discarding commits or moving them to a different state. Reset can be used with different options, such as `--soft`, `--mixed`, or `--hard`, to control how the working directory and index are affected. |

## I committed and realized I needed to fix something before pushing!

> You haven't pushed yet, but you realized you made a minor change to a file you already committed.

Add all the files to index:
```bash
git add .
```

> Never amend to a commit that has already been pushed to a remote repository!
{: .prompt-danger }


**Amend the commit:**
```bash
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

## I committed and pushed, but forgot to pull remote first!

> You committed and tried to push your changes to remote, but you got an error message saying that your local branch is behind the remote branch.

Revert the commits you made to local:
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

Stash the changes you made to local:
```bash
git stash
```

Pull the latest changes from remote:
```bash
git pull
```

Apply the stashed changes to local:
```bash
git stash pop
```

Re-commit the changes to local:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "message"
```

Push the changes to remote:
```bash
git push
```

## I realized I have way too many commits and I want to reduce the number of commits!

> You have a bunch of commits that you want to squash into a single commit.

Check the reflog to find the commit you want to squash to:
```bash
git log --oneline
```

Squash the commits:
```bash
git rebase -i <commit>
```

## I committed and pushed, but forgot to pull remote first and now I have merge conflicts!

> You committed and tried to push your changes to remote, but you got an error message saying that your local branch is behind the remote branch. You also have merge conflicts.

Revert the commits you made to local:
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

Stash the changes you made to local:
```bash
git stash
```

Pull the latest changes from remote:
```bash
git pull
```

Apply the stashed changes to local:
```bash
git stash pop
```

Resolve the merge conflicts:
```bash
git mergetool
```

Re-commit the changes to local:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "message"
```

## I committed and pushed, but forgot to add a file!

> You committed and pushed your changes to remote, but you forgot to add a specific file to the commit.

Add the file to index:
```bash
git add file
```

Amend the commit:
```bash
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

> The next command will force push the changes to remote, overwriting the commit history. **This is only safe if you are the only one working on the repository**!
{: .prompt-danger }

Force push the changes to remote:
```bash
git push --force
```

## I just realized I deleted a file I shouldn't have!

You just realized you deleted a file you shouldn't have, and you want to restore it.

Check the reflog to find the commit where the file was deleted:
```bash
git reflog
```

Restore the file from the commit:
```bash
git checkout <commit> -- file
```

## I just realized I made a mistake in a commit message!

Sometimes it's just one of those days... You had a brain fart and your commit message was not what you intended it to be.

Amend the commit:
```bash
git commit --amend -m "new message"
```

## I just realized I committed to the wrong branch!

Check the reflog to find the commit you want to move:
```bash
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
```

Change to the correct branch:
```bash
git checkout <branch>
```

Move the commit to the correct branch:
```bash
git cherry-pick <commit>
```

## I accidentally committed something to master that should have been on a brand new branch!

Check the reflog to find the commit you want to move:
```bash
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
```

Create a new branch:
```bash
git checkout -b <branch>
```

Move the commit to the new branch:
```bash
git cherry-pick <commit>
```

Rewind back 1 commit on master (**DESTRUCTIVE ACTION**):
```bash
git checkout master
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

Or rewind back to a commit previous to your mistake (**DESTRUCTIVE ACTION**):
```bash
git checkout master
git reset --hard <commit>
```

## I need to see all who have commited, the date they commited, and the commit message!

Check all commits made by all authors:
```bash
git log --pretty=format:"%h%x09%an%x09%ad%x09%s"
```

## I need to see what commits were made on a branch and for what reason!

Check the commit history of a branch:
```bash
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
```

## I need to see what changes were made between two commits!

Check the changes made between two commits:
```bash
git diff <commit_a> <commit_b>
```

## I need to see all commits made by a specific author!

Check all commits made by a specific author:
```bash
git log --author="author"
```

## I need to see all commits made on a specific date!

Check all commits made on a specific date:
```bash
git log --after="date" --before="date"
```

## I need to see all commits made on a specific file!

Check all commits made on a specific file:
```bash
git log -- file
```

Compact the output:
```bash
git log --oneline -- file
```

## I need to see all commits made on a specific line of a file!

Check all commits made on a specific line of a file:
```bash
git log -L <line_start>,<line_end>:<file>
```

## I tried to run a diff but nothing happened!

If you know that you made changes to files, but `diff` is empty, you probably `add`-ed your files to staging and you need to use a special flag.

```git
git diff --staged
```

## I tried to merge conflicts and broke everything!

We've all been there, you're merging a branch and you get a merge conflict.

Change to the branch you want to merge into:
```bash
git checkout <branch>
```

Merge the other branch:
```bash
git merge <other_branch>
```

When you get the merge conflict, accept the other branch's changes:
```bash
git checkout --theirs .
```

## I want to merge a branch, but I want to use my changes, not the other branch's changes.

You're merging a branch and you get a merge conflict. However, you know that your changes are the ones you want to keep.

```bash
git checkout --ours .
```

## I made a lot of major changes to a file and now need something from an older version!

You made a lot of changes to a file and now you need to get something from an older version.

Check log to find all commits related to the file:
```bash
git log -- file
```

## Fuck it, I'm over it...

Watch the world burn:
```bash
cd ..
sudo rm -r my-git-repo/
git clone https://some.github.url/my-git-repo.git
cd my-git-repo/
```

# Conclusion

Woo! That's just pretty much all the major git problems, more will be added later in time.

Hack the Planet!
