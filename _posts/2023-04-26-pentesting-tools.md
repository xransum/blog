A popular competition in the cybersecurity community is known as CTF or "Capture the Flag." These events often take place at hacker conferences such as DEFCON, ROOTCON, HITB, and hackathons. CTF games can be categorized in various ways, including Attack and Defend style, Exploit Development, Packet Capture Analysis, Web Hacking, Digital Puzzles, Cryptography, Stego, Reverse Engineering, Binary Analysis, Mobile Security, and more.

In this article, we'll cover some of the most popular tools used in CTFs and provide examples of how they can be used to solve challenges.
