## Introduction

Phishing attacks continue to pose a significant threat to individuals and organizations, employing deceptive tactics to trick victims into revealing sensitive information or falling victim to malware. Here we'll explore the nature of phishing attacks, their common targets, strategies for protection, and methods for taking action against potential threats.

For an idea of just how prevalent phishing is, consider the following statistics gathered by [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/420391/spam-email-traffic-share/) in 2022:

- **336.1B** emails sent and received per day.
- **283.0B** (88.6%) of those were spam emails.
- **7.0B** (2.5%) of spam were **fraudulent emails**.
- **5.0B** (73%) of *fraudulent emails* were **phishing emails**.
- **1.56B** (33%) of *phishing emails* **contained malware or malicious code**.
- **1 in 12.5M** spam emails get a reply from the recipient.

## What is Phishing?

Phishing is a technique that tricks individuals into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that compromise their security. Attackers create a sense of urgency and employ social engineering tactics to lure victims into clicking on malicious links, leading them to fraudulent websites designed to mimic legitimate ones.

Phishing attacks frequently impersonate financial institutions, colleagues, government agencies, social media platforms, and online payment processors. The combination of urgency and deception increases the likelihood of successful attacks.

## The Ongoing Threat of Phishing Attacks

Despite being one of the oldest cybercrimes, phishing attacks remain a significant threat due to their wide adoption and ever-evolving nature. 

Attackers continuously refine their techniques, gathering more information about their targets to craft highly effective phishing messages.

## Goals of Phishing Attacks

Phishing attacks generally aim to achieve one or more of the following objectives:

1. **Collection of Sensitive Information**: Attackers send deceptive emails to trick victims into revealing login credentials or divulging personally identifiable information (PII). For instance, a phishing scam might involve millions of emails masquerading as a prominent bank, prompting victims to log in on a fake webpage, thereby gaining unauthorized access to their bank accounts.

2. **Malware Distribution**: Phishers often attach malware or ransomware to their emails, attempting to exploit unsuspecting victims who unknowingly download and execute the malicious software.

## Different Types of Phishing Attacks

Phishing attacks can take various forms, all relying on some level of disguise. The specific type of attack employed often depends on the attacker's chosen target(s). For instance:

- **Mass Phishing**: These attacks are widespread and broadly targeted, often impersonating popular brands such as Microsoft, PayPal, or Facebook.

- **Spear Phishing**: In contrast, spear-phishing attacks are highly targeted and customized for specific organizations or individuals.

## Identifying Phishing Attempts

Several indicators can help identify potential phishing attempts:

- **Suspicious URLs**: Be cautious of subdomains, misspelled URLs (typosquatting), or URLs that appear questionable. Pay attention if the sender's email address uses free email providers like Gmail or Outlook, and the domain link in the email content does not match the original domain.

- **Sense of Urgency**: Phishing messages often create a sense of fear or urgency, pressuring recipients to act quickly without thinking critically.

- Requests for Personal Information: Exercise caution if an email requests personal information like banking credentials or social media passwords. Legitimate organizations rarely ask for such sensitive data via email.

- **Grammatical Errors**: Phishing emails may contain noticeable typos, grammatical errors, or poor language quality.

- **Suspicious Attachments**: Be wary of unexpected or unusual email attachments, as they may contain malware or ransomware.

- **Unusual Sender**: If you receive an email from someone you know but the content is unrelated to your usual interactions, especially if it's unrelated to your job responsibilities, exercise caution.

- **Mismatched URLs**: Check if the URL in the email matches the legitimate website it claims to represent.

- **Too Good to Be True**: Be skeptical of emails claiming you have won a contest or prize for something you never entered.

- Utilize Phishing Page Feeds: Keep your system protected by maintaining an updated list of known or detected phishing web pages.

## Investigation Techniques

When it comes to advanced investigation and vetting of potential phishing attempts, Linux commands and other services can provide valuable insights. 

By utilizing these tools, you can dig deeper into the technical aspects and gather more information about suspicious domains, IP addresses, and name servers. 

Here are some additional Linux commands and services that can aid in your investigations:

### Dig

The `dig` command is a versatile tool for DNS (Domain Name System) analysis. It allows you to query DNS records, retrieve information about a domain's DNS configuration, and verify the authenticity of DNS responses.

```bash
dig example.com
```

### Traceroute

The `traceroute` command helps trace the path taken by network packets from your computer to a target IP address. It can assist in understanding the network infrastructure and identify any unexpected hops or routing anomalies.

```bash
traceroute example.com
```

### Reverse DNS Lookup

A reverse DNS lookup allows you to find the domain name associated with a given IP address. This can be helpful in verifying the legitimacy of an IP address used in a phishing attempt.

```bash
host 192.168.1.1
```

### IP Geolocation

To obtain geolocation information for an IP address, you can use services like **ipinfo.io** or **ip-api.com**. These services provide details such as the country, region, city, and Internet service provider (ISP) associated with the IP address.

```bash
curl ipinfo.io/192.168.1.1
```

### DNSBL (DNS-based Blackhole List) Check

DNSBL is a service that identifies and lists IP addresses known to be sources of spam or malicious activities. By checking an IP address against DNSBLs, you can determine if it has a poor reputation.

```bash
host 192.168.1.1.zen.spamhaus.org
```

### WHOIS Lookup

The `whois` command provides detailed information about domain registrations, including contact details of the domain owner, registrar information, and registration dates.

```bash
whois example.com
```

### Whois History

For a comprehensive view of a domain's historical ownership and registration changes, you can utilize WHOIS history services such as **WhoisXML API** or **DomainTools**. These services provide detailed records of a domain's ownership and can help detect any suspicious changes or patterns.


### MX Record Lookup

To determine the mail servers responsible for handling emails for a specific domain, you can perform an MX (Mail Exchanger) record lookup.

```bash
dig example.com MX
```

### SPF Record Lookup

The Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is a DNS record that helps prevent email spoofing. By checking the SPF record, you can verify if the sender's IP address is authorized to send emails on behalf of the domain.

```bash
dig example.com TXT
```

### SSL/TLS Certificate Analysis

Analyzing the SSL/TLS certificate of a website can reveal useful information. The `openssl` command can help extract and examine certificate details, including the common name, issuer, validity period, and certificate chain.

```bash
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect example.com:443
```

### HTTP Headers

Examining the HTTP headers of a website can provide valuable insights into its server configuration and response. The `curl` command can be used to retrieve and analyze HTTP headers.

```bash
curl -I example.com
```

### Validate URLs

To verify the integrity of a URL and ensure they are not malicious or phishing links, you can use the `curl` command to retrieve the webpage content and examine it. 

The flag `-L` instructs `curl` to follow any redirects and retrieve the final URL content.

```bash
curl -L example.com
```

If you want to **check the URL without downloading the content**, you can use the `-I` flag as well.

```bash
curl -IL example.com
```

Replace `example.com` with the actual URL you want to validate. The `-I` flag requests only the response headers, while the `-L` flag follows any redirects.

**Advanced Tip**: You can also use a command called `lynx` to view the webpage content in the terminal. This can be useful if you want to quickly check the content of a URL without opening it in a browser.

```bash
lynx example.com
```

**Advanced Alternative**, `lynx` allows for piping the output of `curl` to it, which can be useful for quickly checking the content of a URL without opening it in a browser.

```bash
curl -L example.com | lynx -stdin -dump
```


### Phishing Website Detection Services

Various online services specialize in detecting phishing websites. These services use machine learning algorithms and reputation databases to determine the likelihood of a website being involved in phishing activities. Examples include **[Google Safe Browsing](https://safebrowsing.google.com/)** and **[PhishTank](https://phishtank.org/)**.

### IP Reputation Check

Online IP reputation services like **[AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/check/)** or **[IPVoid](https://www.ipvoid.com/)** allow you to check the reputation of an IP address and identify if it has been associated with any malicious activities or reported as abusive.


### Threat Intelligence Platforms

Leveraging threat intelligence platforms like **[VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/)** or **[IBM X-Force Exchange](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/)**, you can submit suspicious files, URLs, or IP addresses for analysis. These platforms provide insights from various security vendors and offer additional context on potential threats.

Remember, when conducting investigations, it's essential to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and to use these tools and services responsibly and ethically. Advanced investigation techniques, combined with user awareness and a proactive security mindset, can significantly strengthen your defenses against phishing attacks. Stay vigilant and continually update your knowledge to stay one step ahead of cybercriminals.
