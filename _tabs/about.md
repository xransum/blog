> Hey, I'm Kevin! Welcome to my blog!
{: .prompt-tip }

**A full-stack developer, security researcher, pen-tester, and human.**

I've created this blog aiming to explore various topics primarily focusing toward programming and development, while also touching on the security side of things. My goal is to provide valuable insights and practical advice to help readers improve their knowledge and skills in this field.

If you have any feedback, comments, or questions about my blog, feel free to reach out to me. I would love to hear from you and engage in meaningful discussions.

I actively play CTF's focused Web Security and Reverse Engineering challenges, looking to join team [Shellphish](https://shellphish.net/).
